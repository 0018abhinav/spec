# ![Score](/docs/images/logo.svg) Score overview

_Score_ provides a developer-centric and platform-agnostic workload specification to improve developer productivity and experience. Score eliminates configuration inconsistencies between local and remote environments.

The _Platform CLI_ is a conversion tool for application developers to generate an environment specific configuration. In combination with environment specific parameters, The Platform CLI tool can run your Workload in the target environment by generating the target platform's configuration file.

## ![Overview](/docs/images/overview.svg) Overview

The Score specification file resolves configuration inconsistencies between environments. Compose a `score.yaml` file that describes how to run your Workload. As a platform-agnostic declaration file, `score.yaml` creates a single source of truth on Workload profiles and works to integrate with any platform or tooling.

Learn more about the Score specification [here](/score%20schema.md).
